# Gnome + tiling manager
In my opinion it's the best to also have some sort of display manager to fallback to.

In general I found that bspwm works the best (at least on debian). Also it's probably too much of a hustle to get it working with home-manager, so it's probably better to install the window managers with the default package manager.
