## Window managers

In my opinion it's the best to also have some sort of display manager to fallback to (Gnome, xfce).

In general I found that bspwm works the best (at least on debian). From the wayland ones, sway is probably the best.

Also it's too much of a hustle to get the wayland ones working with home-manager, so it's probably better to install them with the default package manager.
